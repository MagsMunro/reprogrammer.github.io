## Abstract

Researchers use file-based Version Control System (VCS) as the primary source of
code evolution data. VCSs are widely used by developers, thus, researchers get
easy access to historical data of many projects. Although it is convenient,
research based on VCS data is incomplete and imprecise. Moreover, answering
questions that correlate code changes with other activities (e.g., test runs,
refactoring) is impossible.

Our tool, CodingTracker, non-intrusively records fine-grained and diverse data
during code development. CodingTracker collected data from 24 developers: 1,652
hours of development, 23,002 committed files, and 314,085 testcase runs.

This allows us to answer: How much code evolution data is not stored in VCS? How
much do developers intersperse refactorings and edits in the same commit? How
frequently do developers fix failing tests by changing the test itself? How many
changes are committed to VCS without being tested? What is the temporal and
spacial locality of changes?
