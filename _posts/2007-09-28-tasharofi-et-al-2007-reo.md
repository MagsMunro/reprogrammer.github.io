## Abstract

In this paper we propose an approach to derive the formal semantics of WS-BPEL
processes compositionally using Reo and constraint automata. We map each WS-BPEL
process into a Reo circuit and then construct the corresponding constraint
automaton which shows the behavior of the process. The constraint automaton can
be used for analyzing the process behavior. Our work covers the core part of the
WS-BPEL language including basic and structured activities, correlation sets,
variables, and links.
