## Abstract

Developing concurrent software is error prone. Others have cataloged common bug
patterns in concurrent Java programs. But, there are no tools for detecting
complex concurrency bug patterns accurately, and concurrent programs are full of
similar bugs. We have been developing a tool called Keshmesh for detecting
complex concurrency bug patterns in Java programs statically. Keshmesh is the
first tool that accurately detects a few of the top concurrency bug patterns of
the SEI CERT catalog and suggests automated fixers for some of them. Keshmesh is
fast enough to be used interactively, produces few false alarms and helps Java
programmers to quickly find and fix common concurrency bug patterns in their
programs.
