## Abstract

Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) such as Eclipse and Visual Studio
provide tools and capabilities to perform tasks such as navigating among
classes and methods, continuous compilation, code refactoring, automated
testing, and integrated debugging all designed to increase productivity.
Instrumenting the IDE to collect usage data provides a more fine-grained
understanding on developers' work than previously possible. Usage data supports
analysis of how developers spend their time, what activities might benefit from
greater tool support, where developers have difficulty comprehending code, and
whether they are following specific practices such as test-driven development.
With usage data, we expect to uncover more nuggets of how developers create
mental models, how they investigate code, how they perform mini trial-and-error
experiments, and what might drive productivity improvements for everyone.
