## Abstract

The industry crossed the first refactoring rubicon, namely Extract Method, more
than a decade ago. Today, all mainstream Integrated Development Environments
(IDEs) support this refactoring, and empirical studies have shown that Extract
Method is one of the most frequently used automated refactorings. Although
complex refactorings are more tedious and error-prone, studies have shown that
programmers use the automated refactorings mostly for performing simple changes.
We argue that new interaction models are needed to support high-level composite
refactorings. Because of the challenges involved in automating such complex
refactorings, we consider composite refactorings as the next refactoring
rubicons.
