## Abstract

Even though modern Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) support many
refactorings, studies suggest that automated refactorings are used infrequently,
and few developers use anything beyond Rename and Extract refactorings. Little
is known about why automated refactorings are seldom used. We present a list of
challenging questions whose answers are crucial for understanding the usability
issues of refactoring tools. This paper argues that the existing data
sources—Eclipse UDC, Eclipse refactoring histories, version control histories,
etc.—are inadequate for answering these questions. Finally, we introduce our
tools to collect richer usage data that will enable us to answer some of the
open research questions about the usability of refactoring tools. Findings from
our data will foster the design of the next generation of refactoring tools.
