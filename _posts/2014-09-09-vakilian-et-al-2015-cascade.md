## Abstract

Type qualifier inference tools usually operate in batch mode and assume that
the program must not be changed except to add the type qualifiers. In practice,
programs must be changed to make them type-correct, and programmers must
understand them. Cascade is an interactive type qualifier inference tool that
is easy to implement and universal (i.e., it can work for any type qualifier
system for which a checker is implemented). It shows that qualifier inference
can achieve better results by involving programmers rather than relying solely
on automation.
